One's own face serves as a visual signpost of identity. However, our face is not static; it changes due to grooming activities and aging. In this project, we explore how our cognitive system uses multisensory signals (i.e., visual, kinesthetic, etc.) to accommodate these changes and maintain the sense of self over time.
