In our lab, we utilize brain stimulation techniques, such as Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), to study the direct relationship between the brain and cognition. Additionally, we employ these techniques to enhance various cognitive processes in both neurotypical and neurodivergent populations.
